# Overview

## Problem statement

So, the New Year holidays are over. Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two “Star Kids” meet, their assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest’s name and the host’s name in honor of this event. Then they hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of the characters’ names. Then he might have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.

The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there is no missing letters and that nobody will need to cut more letters.

Help the “Star Kids” and their friends to solve this problem. You are given both inscriptions that are hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.
